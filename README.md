How to Play the Game

The game consists of 12 to 24 cards shuffled in a grid. The cards have pictures of male and female inventors.

At start player chooses a level:

"easy" = 6 pairs
"medium" = 8 pairs
"hard" = 12 pairs

The player then chooses a card, looks at the picture and then selects another card.
If the cards match then they will stay visible. When the cards do not match they will be hidden.
The object of the game is to match all of the pairs of cards.
A timer to will track how long it takes to complete the matches and shows time taken to complete the game.
The player starts out with 3 stars. The longer it takes to match all the cards, the more stars will be lost.
At the end of the game a pop-up will show time taken, stars earned and number of moves made.
